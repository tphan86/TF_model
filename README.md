# Four-state thin filament model

The code was run using the version of MATLAB R2023 with global optimization toolbox installed. `Genetic Algorithm` and `Pattern Search` were
utilized to fit the model to the mechanical data in murine and porcine left ventricles (taken from the [paper](https://rupress.org/jgp/article/155/11/e202213315/276275/Cooperative-mechanisms-underlie-differences-in)).
